# Notes about using traveling-ruby


Traveling-Ruby now supports aarch64 builds of Ruby `2.6.10` which is the required version for Homebrew.

Homebrew although it supports Linux, does not support `aarch64` as Portable ruby does not provide bottles.

- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby/blob/master/Formula/portable-ruby.rb

## TODO

1. `./install.sh`
   1. [x] Update to allow `aarch64` linux installs
2. Homebrew ruby lookup fails on linux. both resolved in https://github.com/you54f/brew
   1. [X] `aarch64` fails to find ruby `2.6.10` on path, and errors on `brew update`
   2. [X] `x86_64` pours portable-ruby despite ruby being first on path.
3. [ ] Homebrew Binary support for aarch64
   1. [ ] No aarch64 builds for following binaries
      1. [ ] https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/4119
      2. [ ] https://gist.github.com/ethankhall/516ddcefd22297a6cb9f736648386292
4. Portable Ruby
   1. Update bottles to include `aarch64` build from traveling ruby.
